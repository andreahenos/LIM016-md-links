## 3. Guide to use ðŸ“˜

### Syntax:

> **md-links <*path*> [*option*]**

** *Path* **: 

Absolute or relative path to a file or directory.

** *Options* **:
- If you don't add an option, the `default response` is the URL, the attached text within the file, and the file path where the link was found.

-  **-validate**: 

The -validate option returns the URL, the attached text within the file and the path of the file where the link was found, its status and a message. The message will be 'ok' if the link works, otherwise it will be 'fail'.

 > You can access this option with `md-links <path> -validate ` or `md-links <path> -v `


- **-stats**:

The result will be basic statistics about the links found. You will be able to see the total number of links and the number of unique links.

> You can access this option with `md-links <path> -stats` or `md-links <path> -s`

- **-validate -stats**:

It will show basic statistics and the results of link validation.

> You can access this option with `md-links <path> -validate -stats` or `md-links <path> -v -s`


- Use  `md-links -help`  or `md-links -h` to see all supported commands

### Other responses:

  - **"Path doesn't exists"** : When the entered path is incorrect or doesn't exist.
  - **"No links to analyze"** :

      -When the path is to an empty file or folder.

      -When the file is not Markdown.

      -When the folder contains no Markdown files.

      -When the file does not contain links.
